# Phase 3 Task 3.1: Node Selection System - COMPLETED

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive node selection system for the BitCrafty React Flow graph interface. **Fixed critical infinite loop issue** caused by direct store usage in node components.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Store State Management
- **File**: `src/types/store.ts`
  - Added `hoveredNode: string | null` to track hover state
  - Added `highlightedEdges: Set<string>` for future edge highlighting
  - Added `searchResults: Set<string>` for search functionality
  - Extended `AppActions` interface with new selection actions

### 2. Store Actions Implementation
- **File**: `src/lib/store.ts`
  - Added `setHoveredNode()` action for hover state management
  - Added `setSearchResults()` action for search integration
  - Created memoized selectors for all new state properties
  - Updated action hooks to include new functions

### 3. React Flow Integration
- **File**: `src/components/graph/GraphContainer.tsx`
  - Added `onNodeClick` handler for node selection toggle
  - Added `onNodeMouseEnter` and `onNodeMouseLeave` for hover tracking
  - Added `onPaneClick` handler for background click deselection
  - **Enhanced node data**: Pass selection/hover state through node data rather than direct store access
  - Integrated store actions with React Flow event handlers

### 4. Enhanced Node Components (Performance Optimized)
- **Files**: `src/components/graph/nodes/ItemNode.tsx` and `CraftNode.tsx`
  - **Fixed Infinite Loop**: Removed direct store selectors from node components
  - Props-based selection state instead of store subscriptions
  - Added hover state visual feedback
  - Enhanced styling with dynamic borders and shadows
  - Added smooth transitions for selection/hover states
  - Implemented visual scaling for selected nodes
  - **Custom memo comparison**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders

### 5. Node Wrapper Architecture
- **File**: `src/components/graph/nodes/NodeWrappers.tsx`
  - Created wrapper components to handle props conversion
  - Decoupled node rendering from store state management
  - Improved performance by reducing store subscriptions

### 6. Updated Type Definitions
- **File**: `src/types/graph.ts`
  - Added `isSelected` and `isHovered` properties to node data types
  - Enhanced type safety for selection state management

## Technical Details

### Selection Behavior
- **Single Selection**: Only one node can be selected at a time
- **Toggle Selection**: Clicking a selected node deselects it
- **Background Deselection**: Clicking empty space deselects current node
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected nodes have thicker borders, glowing shadows, and slight scaling

### Hover Behavior
- **Hover State**: Mouse enter/leave events update hover state
- **Visual Feedback**: Hovered nodes have subtle shadow effects
- **State Persistence**: Hover state is tracked globally in store

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoized Selectors**: All state selectors use React 18 compatible memoization
- **Callback Optimization**: Event handlers use `useCallback` for stable references
- **Component Memoization**: Node components use `React.memo` for render optimization

## Validation Criteria Met ✅

1. **Store Enhancement**: ✅ Added selection state properties to AppState
2. **Action Implementation**: ✅ Created and implemented selection actions
3. **React Flow Integration**: ✅ Added click and hover handlers
4. **Visual Feedback**: ✅ Enhanced node styling with selection/hover states
5. **Performance**: ✅ Optimized with memoization and stable references
6. **TypeScript Compliance**: ✅ Full type safety with no compilation errors

## Testing Status
- **Development Server**: ✅ Running without errors
- **Browser Testing**: ✅ Interface loads correctly
- **Interactive Testing**: Ready for user validation

## Next Steps
With Task 3.1 complete, the foundation is now ready for:
- **Task 3.2**: Edge highlighting based on selected nodes
- **Task 3.3**: Search functionality with visual result highlighting
- **Task 3.4**: Node details panel integration

## Files Modified
```
src/types/store.ts - Enhanced AppState and AppActions interfaces
src/lib/store.ts - Added selection actions and memoized selectors
src/components/graph/GraphContainer.tsx - Added React Flow event handlers + enhanced node data
src/components/graph/nodes/ItemNode.tsx - Props-based selection (fixed infinite loop)
src/components/graph/nodes/CraftNode.tsx - Props-based selection (fixed infinite loop)
src/components/graph/nodes/NodeWrappers.tsx - NEW: Wrapper components for props handling
src/components/BitCraftyFlowProvider.tsx - Updated to use wrapper components
src/types/graph.ts - Added isSelected/isHovered properties to node data types
```

## Performance Fixes
- ✅ **Fixed Primary Infinite Loop**: Removed direct store subscriptions from node components
- ✅ **Fixed Secondary Infinite Loop**: Replaced `useStoreActions()` with individual action hooks
- ✅ **Props-based State**: Selection state passed through node data instead of store hooks
- ✅ **Custom Memo Comparison**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders of node components
- ✅ **Wrapper Architecture**: Decoupled node rendering from store management
- ✅ **Reduced Store Subscriptions**: Only GraphContainer subscribes to selection state
- ✅ **Stable Action References**: Individual action hooks provide stable references

## Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ✅ React 18 compatibility
- ✅ Memoized selectors for performance
- ✅ **Individual action hooks**: Stable references, no infinite loops
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive state management
- ✅ **Performance optimized**: Multiple infinite loop fixes applied

**Status**: COMPLETE ✅
**Ready for**: Phase 3 Task 3.2 (Edge Highlighting)
